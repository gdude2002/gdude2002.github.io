*Update: If you want to hang out, feel free to join [the **The Archives** server](https://discord.gg/jaDdt9p), 
which is where most of my friends and the members of my old community hang out.*

Some of you are probably confused. You might be wondering why my other posts are gone, or why I'm no longer on 
Python Discord or its related servers. This post is intended to serve as an explanation - but first, let's take 
a look at how I got to this point. 

# Where it all began

I'm a classical Reddit lurker. Hanging out in seedy alleys, watching and remaining hidden, peeking around corners -
and one day, I noticed a new post on `r/Python` from this guy named Joseph who was advertising a Python community
on Discord. 

Up until this point I was wondering why I'd never seen a Python Discord server around before - and since I was 
right in the middle of my love affair with Discord, I decided to join and see what was going on. 

I think the term "organised chaos" is pretty appropriate for what I found. Still, the staff seemed nice for the 
most part so I decided to stick around and help out. Within a few weeks, I ended up on the staff team. 

One of the current staff members at the time was a real piece of work. A huge bully that let power run to his head, 
and that thought he was above everyone else. Once I joined the team, he didn't last long - with the help of an admin,
I made a complaint and he was removed from the team. I would later end up banning him at the start of our first 
code jam. 

# Growth and achievement

Since then, the community has gone from strength to strength. The staff team has evolved to a large group of like-minded
and extremely skilled individuals who all have the best interests of the community at heart. We went from a single 
absentee owner to three highly active co-owners, looking after a staff team of around 50 members and a userbase of almost 
12,000 users. 

This community has been amazing (despite the threats and few bad eggs) and I couldn't be prouder of it. I definitely feel 
like I'm a better person because of my participation there, and it's helped me grow both personally and professionally - 
but the world isn't all flowers and unicorns, and that applies here too. 

# So, what's your problem, man? 

If this were a video or podcast, I'd be telling you to go get a drink or something. It's story time! 

About 7 years ago, Minecraft was in its prime. I ran a generally successful community, and around this time a new user 
joined up - we'll call her J. 

J was an excellent builder and a generally warm and kindhearted person, and we quickly became friends. She became a 
moderator and later an admin, and she was an amazing member of our staff team. 

As her building skills grew, she began to make new friends within our community and she became known in some of the 
professional building communities. Things were going well online - but a few years after we became friends, something 
happened. 

Soon after, J was diagnosed with depression - something that can sneak up on the best of us. Since then, we've been 
extremely present in each other's lives - supporting each other through everything, and generally growing closer. 

Nine months ago, things started getting tough for J. I started spending huge amounts of time supporting her and generally 
being there for her - and while I don't regret a thing, this did mean my activity on Python Discord suffered. Everyone was 
very understanding after I explained, of course - that was never a problem. 

It's been a complicated ride, and J and I have gone through a lot of personal changes in this time - and while I wouldn't 
change anything about J for the world, things have occasionally been tough. 

# What does this mean for PyDis? 

Over the last few months or so, I've been considering my position on the server, as well as the things I do and follow online. 
I've been feeling pretty bad as a result - in my personal life at home, during some of the time I spend online, and during my 
time on the Python server as well. 

In general, I've been unhappy with my levels of activity when it comes to server projects. I've felt bad because I've been 
unable to motivate myself to help out. I feel like I haven't been able to contribute anything of substance recently - not 
even a single objectively good idea - to our projects. 

I have my own issues, of course. I've talked about them at length in the staff channels and people have mostly been 
receptive - but as my mood and psychology have shifted, it felt like some members of staff were unwilling to take the time to 
listen to me, and understand what I was dealing with and the things they could do to help with them. I felt like I wasn't being 
taken seriously and my mental health has suffered as a result.

Now, I don't entirely blame the other staff members for this. At the end of the day I'm responsible for my own mental health, 
and some of the things I was struggling with were basic personality traits of some of the staff members. I'm sure anyone else 
would have struggled to change in these ways too - but the fact remains that I need to take care of myself. 

So yesterday, after another example of the above, I decided to leave the server. I've transferred everything I possibly could 
think of to Lemon, who is an excellent staff member and will have no trouble handling the few small things I was still helping 
out with. 

To be clear, there have been other things that I've needed to deal with - I've recreated or cleaned up all of my social media 
accounts, for example. The people I consider closest to me have been a huge help - to B, E, G and J (you know who you are), I 
could not be the person I am today without your support. I love you guys, and I would be totally screwed up without you - more 
than I already am, at any rate. Some of you have suggested I seek professional help, and I am looking into that. I hope I can 
continue to rely on you guys as much as you rely on me. 

# So, what now? 

That's a great question. Unfortunately, I don't have any real answer for you. I'm sure many people will be pondering the big 
question: *Will you be back?*

Right now, **I just don't know**. It's far too early to say what's going to happen. But one thing is for sure - I need to look 
after myself and spend time with the people closest to me. 

With or without me, I know Python Discord will remain as a pillar of the Python community at large, and I'm sure it will be 
even more successful as time goes on.

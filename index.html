    Hello, and welcome to my site! This site is a dedicated repository of information about me,
    the gserv.me operation, the services I host, and the people I work with. It also serves
    as a personal blog, replacing the old Ghost-powered blog I used to maintain.
</p>

<p>
    This site is powered by Jekyll, generated directly from Markdown files on GitHub and served
    by GitHub Pages. If youâ€™re curious about how this looks, 
    <a href="https://github.com/gdude2002/gdude2002.github.io">check out the repository</a>! 
    All post comments are also stored there as issues, handled by 
    <a href="https://utteranc.es/">Utterances</a>.
</p>

<p>
    If you'd like to learn a bit more about me, you can take a look at the <a href="/about">about page</a>.

<p>Hello, and welcome to my site! This site is a dedicated repository of information about me,
the gserv.me operation, the services I host, and the people I work with. It also serves
as a personal blog, replacing the old Ghost-powered blog I used to maintain.</p>

<p>This site is powered by Jekyll, generated directly from Markdown files on GitHub and served
by GitHub Pages. If you’re curious about how this looks, 
<a href="https://github.com/gdude2002/gdude2002.github.io">check out the repository</a>! All post comments
are also stored there as issues, handled by <a href="https://utteranc.es/">Utterances</a>.</p>

<h2 id="about-me">About Me</h2>

<p>I’m an English programmer living in Ireland, specialising mainly in Python but with experience
in a wide range of technologies. I’ve been working in IT from a hobbyist perspective since 2008,
and have many related interests - including devops (including orchestration, CI and deployment), 
tooling, community and project management, to name a few.</p>

<p>As a huge supporter of the open source community at large, you’ll find many of my projects are
available for free, under permissive open-source licenses. You can head over to the 
<a href="/portflio">portfolio page</a> for more information on that, or see below for my primary project 
involvements.</p>

<h2 id="python-discord-2017---2018">Python Discord (2017 - 2018)</h2>

<p><a href="https://pythondiscord.com">Python Discord</a> is a fantastic community for budding Python beginners
and experts alike to chat about Python, hone their skills and help each other out. It’s maintained
by a large, dedicated staff team comprised of Python experts from around the world, and every one
of them is committed to providing an excellent community for Pythonistas everywhere.</p>

<p>I joined PyDis (as it came to be known) as a regular user, from a post on Reddit by 
<a href="https://github.com/jos-b">Joseph</a>  (the overall server owner, at the time of writing). I started 
helping users out and quickly found myself climbing the staff ranks to admin, and eventually took 
my place as a co-owner - alongside <a href="https://github.com/jos-b">Joseph</a> and 
<a href="https://github.com/heavysaturn">Leon</a>.</p>

<p>PyDis is one of the many supporters of the open-source movement, and as such has many open source 
projects <a href="https://github.com/python-discord">available on GitHub</a> - including a couple PyPi packages. 
Many of these projects are made use of within PyDis itself, such as their website and Discord bot 
projects.</p>

<p>In the last days of 2018, I decided to 
<a href="/why-is-your-name-white-gdude/">leave the community for mental health reasons</a>. It’s still an 
excellent community full of amazing people - but sometimes you just need to take care of yourself.</p>

<h2 id="glowstone-2015---present">Glowstone (2015 - Present)</h2>

<p>Glowstone is an established Minecraft custom server project, which has existed in one form or another for
a very long time - rising to the foreground for many people as a result of 
<a href="https://www.spigotmc.org/threads/dmcad.28536/">the Bukkit DMCA drama</a>, to provide a possible replacement
for it.</p>

<p>Glowstone has always aimed to be a free, open-source implementation of the Bukkit API - containing no
propritary code and attempting to match the behaviour of the official server as closely as possible.</p>

<p>While I haven’t contributed any code to this project, I’ve provided my support to it in several ways:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Hosting services, including the <a href="https://repo.glowstone.net/">Maven repo</a>, 
<a href="https://glowstone.net/">website</a>, <a href="https://forums.glowstone.net/">forums</a> and, previously, the 
continuous integration service and Minecraft testing server.</li>
  <li>Taking an active role on the <a href="https://discord.gg/TFJqhsC">Discord community</a>, dealing with automation
tasks and helping out with community management.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="ultros-2011---present">Ultros (2011 - Present)</h2>

<p><a href="https://ultros.io">Ultros</a> is one of my older pet projects - a multi-network, fully modular chat bot. 
Written entirely in Python, it began life as a simple helper bot for the MCBans IRC channel - taking 
care of some basic tasks, such as standard anti-spam and providing access to the MCBans API.</p>

<p>When I was suddenly removed from the MCBans team, the project undertook some changes and was renamed to
<a href="https://ultros.io">Ultros</a>. With the help of <a href="https://www.rakiru.com/">Leagsaidh Gordon</a> (who joined the
project back in the MCBans days, around the start of 2012), Ultros has become a capable bot and is in use
by multiple communities today.</p>

<p>Due to lack of time to dedicate to this project, it has been stalled for some time. It’s currently in the
middle of a large rewrite to Python 3, which will also address a lot of edge cases and other issues we came
across in the original iteration. That said, the <a href="https://github.com/UltrosBot/Ultros">old version</a> is still
entirely functional and in use by a few communities!</p>

<h2 id="the-archives-2018---2015">The Archives (2018 - 2015)</h2>

<p><a href="https://archivesmc.com">The Archives</a> was my first real introduction to Linux and the world of programming in
general. A Minecraft community that originally made waves as the world’s first Minecraft server to support
multiple worlds, finite liquid physics, message blocks and portals (to name a few features), I inherited
ownership of this community from its original creator - Django maintainer 
<a href="http://www.aeracode.org/">Andrew Godwin</a> - when he no longer had the time to maintain it.</p>

<p>Over the years, The Archives went through many iterations - from existing simply as a simple server application
running on a VPS paid for by <a href="https://github.com/Adam01">Adam Guy</a>, to being located across a cluster of servers
in <a href="https://twitter.com/aythrea">Aythrea</a>’s appartment, to being run across a few large dedicated servers in a
datacentre in Canada. The Archives was never as large as today’s super-popular Minecraft server networks, but it
still garnered an active, local community through most of its life, with several members sticking around for the
entire seven years.</p>

<p>Towards its latter years, I became responsible for hosting all of The Archives and its services. At its peak, it
included a Drupal-powered site, a Discourse forum, nine Minecraft servers, a Starbound server, a Team Fortress 2
server, an IRC server and a (janky) Postfix setup for email. It also included a Steam group, several IRC channels
across four networks in total, a Facebook group, and a YouTube channel.</p>

<p>Eventually, the buzz around Minecraft fizzled out and users began to move on to other servers and games. The
Archives closed its doors in October of 2015 - and while there are no plans for a return, the remaining commmunity
is still active on <a href="https://discord.gg/jaDdt9p">its Discord server</a>.</p>
